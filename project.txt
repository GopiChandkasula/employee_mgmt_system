The views will have the following features:
Admin View: Display a list of all users and absence requests. Allow the admin to add, edit, and delete users and approve/reject absence requests.

Manager View: Display a list of employees under the manager and their absence requests. Allow the manager to approve/reject absence requests and edit employee details.

Employee View: Display a list of the employee's absence requests. Allow the employee to create new absence requests and edit their own details.
The frontend will be built using Vue.js and Vuetify, a material design component framework for Vue.js. The views will communicate with the backend API using Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript.
